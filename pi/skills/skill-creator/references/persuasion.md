# Persuasion Principles for Skill Design

LLMs respond to the same persuasion principles as humans. These patterns ensure
critical practices are actually followed, not just documented.

Based on Meincke et al. (2025) — N=28,000 AI conversations. Persuasion techniques
more than doubled compliance rates (33% → 72%).

## Most Effective for Skills

### Authority
Imperative language eliminates rationalization. Use for discipline-enforcing rules.

```markdown
✅ YOU MUST verify the post exists after uploading. No exceptions.
❌ Consider checking if the post was created successfully.
```

### Commitment
Require explicit announcements and tracking. Creates consistency pressure.

```markdown
✅ Before posting, announce: "Posting to [platform] with [image]"
❌ Post to the platform when ready.
```

### Scarcity / Urgency
Time-bound requirements prevent "I'll do it later" drift.

```markdown
✅ IMMEDIATELY after posting, verify the URL is live before proceeding.
❌ You can verify the post when convenient.
```

### Social Proof
Establish universal patterns. "X without Y = failure" framing.

```markdown
✅ Posting without verification = broken links. Every time.
❌ Some users find post-verification helpful.
```

## Principle Combinations by Skill Type

| Type | Use | Avoid |
|------|-----|-------|
| Posting/publishing | Authority + Scarcity | Liking |
| Analytics/data | Moderate authority + Unity | Heavy authority |
| Creative/generation | Unity + Commitment | Authority |
| Reference/lookup | Clarity only | All persuasion |

## Key Insight: Bright-Line Rules

"YOU MUST" removes decision fatigue. Absolute language eliminates "is this an
exception?" rationalizations. "When X, do Y" is more effective than "generally do Y."

## Anti-Patterns

- **Liking for compliance** — Creates sycophancy, conflicts with honest feedback
- **Reciprocity** — Feels manipulative, rarely needed
- **Combining too many** — Pick 2-3 principles max per skill
- **Using for reference skills** — Pure information doesn't need persuasion
